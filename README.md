# Agile Sprint Tracker for Process Improvement
Led a 3-month initiative to cut task delivery time by 15% as a Business Analyst.
- Planned 3 sprints in Jira (`sprint_plan.txt`).
- Mapped workflows (`process_workflow.pdf`).
- Analyzed delays with SQL, visualized in Power BI (`efficiency_report.pbix`).
- Presented gains to stakeholders (`stakeholder_update.pdf`).
Reflects my 7+ years optimizing processes with Agile and data tools.
